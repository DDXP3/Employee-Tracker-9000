# Employee Tracker 9000

## Description

        The Employee Tracker 9000, is an application that will allow a user to track employees.
         - My movtive in this project was to make a application that allowed me to track employees, their roles and which department they work for.
         - I made this project because sometimes I wanted to make sure I'm able to find employess, their role, and which department they work for so I could manage my team in a more fluid way.
         - This project can be used to help me make work meetings easier, as you could look for certain employees and ask for speciffic departments to join the meeting, for example looking for the employess for the art department for a meeting about the graphic design of a webpage.
         - I learned more about express and servers while working on this project. While working on this project, I also learned about how to set up data base and how to use mysql along side with how to make functions that allowed me to view, add, remove, or update the data base.

        On this project I worked with Jason like usual. For this project instead of out right telling me what I needed, we challenged me and asked me what I thought I needed. This allowed me to raise the bar on myself and try to learn how to code by myself. He helped me where ever I got stuck on this project.
